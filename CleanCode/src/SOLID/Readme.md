# SOLID

"Solid" is an acronym used to describe a set of design principles for creating more robust, scalable and maintainable software systems.

It was proposed by Robert C. Martin and is based on five key principles:

S - Single Responsibility Principle (Single Responsibility Principle):

    Each class or module in a system should have a single reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.

O - Open/Closed Principle:

    Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    This encourages extensibility without altering existing code.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle:

    Objects of a superclass must be able to be replaced by objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

I - Interface Segregation Principle:

    Clients should not be forced to rely on interfaces that they do not use.
    This promotes the creation of smaller and more specific interfaces.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle:

    High-level classes should not depend on low-level classes, but both should depend on abstractions.
    This promotes greater flexibility and facilitates component substitution.

These principles are part of the object-oriented programming paradigm and are used to design software systems that are easier to understand.
